# Release-artifact checks, run on the EXACT binary that ships (right after
# each platform build in release-signed.yml):
#   1. the development-only engine runner `__migrate-run` refuses in every
#      mode (forward, --rollback, --detect, --doctor, --dump-prefs-domain)
#      with exit 2 and the fixed refusal text — release builds are stamped
#      to a bare SemVer, which is what closes it; the managed-Playwright
#      crash-injection driver (`__playwright-selftest --child-run`) refuses
#      the same way;
#   2. the migration path itself still answers: `migrate --status`,
#      `migrate --dump-spec`, `__migrate-probe`, `__migrate-gate` — the
#      commands the installer and the production migration use — so the
#      gate demonstrably closed only the runner.
# Everything runs in a scratch HOME/XDG tree; nothing on the runner is read
# or written outside it.
