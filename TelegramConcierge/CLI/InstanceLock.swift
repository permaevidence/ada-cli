/// Exclusive per-user lease for conversation-owning modes (`briglia` chat,
/// `briglia daemon`) and for `briglia quicksetup` while it writes
/// configuration. Two conversation owners would long-poll the same Telegram
/// bot (Telegram splits updates randomly between competing pollers) and race
/// on the same conversation, archive and reminder files — so the second one
/// must refuse to start instead of silently corrupting shared state.
///
/// Uses flock(2): advisory, and released automatically when the process dies
/// for any reason, so a crash can never leave a stale lock behind. `briglia
/// setup` / `briglia doctor` deliberately do NOT take the lease — they must
/// work while a daemon is running.
///
/// The lease is an OBJECT with explicit ownership (Codex, quick-setup plan
/// round 2): a second `flock` on a fresh descriptor blocks even inside the
/// same process, so "the chat re-acquires what quick setup already holds"
/// cannot work — quick setup hands its lease object to `TerminalSession`
/// instead (`adopting:`), and every owner releases explicitly. Dropping a
/// held lease is a bug; the `deinit` fallback releases FIRST (so a debug trap
/// can never strand the lock), then logs, then asserts.
